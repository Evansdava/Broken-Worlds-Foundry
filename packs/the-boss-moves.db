Detail your gang and some of its members to your GM and name it.</p>\n<p>Choose 1 main racket for your gang. This is how your gang makes its living:</p>\n<p>&ndash;Extortion and &lsquo;Dues&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&ndash;Mercenary work and &lsquo;Protection&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&ndash;Smuggling and other &lsquo;Business&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&ndash;Thievery and &lsquo;Acquisitions&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&ndash;Trading in goods of &lsquo;Acceptable legality&rsquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your gang completely lacks any semblance of discipline, brains, or bravery, but they love each other very much.</p>\n<p>At any point, you have about 10-15 of these total bastards hanging around, protecting you and doing your dirty work. You&rsquo;ll always have about that many no matter what or how many you lose (they&rsquo;ll come out of the woodwork eventually). If they all get wiped out, revolt, or if you get totally separated from them for whatever reason, you lose the @Compendium[brokenworlds.tags.bq8lXxUCLGIvJn2R]{Group} tag and the use of your gang-based moves until you rest and can get them back.</p>\n<p>Think about your gang as an extension of yourself. Members of your gang can separate out and perform tasks for you, but when they do, they are handled much like other npcs. Similarly, you can separate from your gang, but can&rsquo;t command them effectively if you do. You and the gang are basically synonymous.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re with your gang and commanding them, you gain the @Compendium[brokenworlds.tags.bq8lXxUCLGIvJn2R]{Group} tag, so you deal +1 damage to non-group targets and take -1 damage from them. When you separate from your gang, you lose this tag. Your gang doesn&rsquo;t function effectively without you commanding them (they&rsquo;re a bit thick), and if your gang needs to perform a task separate from you (for example, guarding an area while you split from them) a Dirty Work move will determine how well they do. Otherwise use your statistics to represent the gang.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your gang fights with a motley assortment of weaponry and styles. They might even all fight with the same weapon (there&rsquo;s a reason they call them the Axe Gang). Decide what weapons they have. It&rsquo;s totally possible (and likely) for members of your gang to get snuffed in combat, but don&rsquo;t sweat it too much. You can decide when named members of the gang bite it, but any number of faceless mooks will probably die for you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have a new statistic, which is tracked as +BOSS (the capitals are important). Your +BOSS statistic represents your poise, command, and general sex appeal, and like other statistics can go from +3 to -3. It starts at 0.&nbsp;Any time you make a move, you can declare you are making an example for your gang with your actions.</p>\n<p><strong>On a 7+</strong>, no matter the result, raise your +BOSS statistic by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>On a 2-6</strong>, lower it by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>On double 6s</strong>, raise it by 2.</p>\n<p><strong>On two ones</strong>, lower it by 2.</p>","class":"The Boss","rollType":"","rollMod":0,"requiresLevel":0,"requiresMove":"","moveType":"starting","moveGroup":""},"flags":{},"img":"systems/brokenworlds/assets/icons/skills/death2.png","effects":[],"_id":"W8gR0TIYXkEDGUlX"}
